# ARC Raiders Skill Tree Builder

An interactive skill tree builder and planner for **ARC Raiders**, allowing players to plan and optimize their skill point allocation across three major branches: **Conditioning**, **Mobility**, and **Survival**.

## Features

### 🎯 Interactive Skill Tree
- **Visual Skill Tree**: Navigate through 45+ skill nodes across three branches
- **Real-time Point Tracking**: Monitor your skill point allocation (max 75 points)
- **Prerequisite System**: Visual connections show skill dependencies
- **Category Requirements**: Some skills require minimum points in their category tree

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Zoom & Pan**: Drag to pan, scroll to zoom (0.4x - 2.5x)
- **Share Builds**: Generate shareable links for your skill builds
- **Reset Function**: Quickly reset your entire build
- **Tooltips**: Hover over skills to see detailed information

### AI Build Advisor
- **Generate or review builds**: Create a build from preferences or analyze the current tree
- **Structured recommendations**: See point changes, reasoning, and tradeoffs before applying
- **Server-side API access**: RapidAPI credentials remain on the Node.js server

### 📊 Skill Categories

#### Conditioning
Focus on stamina management, shield efficiency, and survival capabilities. Perfect for tank builds and endurance-focused raiders.

#### Mobility  
Enhance movement speed, climbing, vaulting, and dodge mechanics. Ideal for aggressive players and PvP combatants.

#### Survival
Improve looting speed, inventory capacity, and resource management. Essential for solo raiders and loot specialists.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd arcradiersskill
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add your RapidAPI configuration:
     ```
     RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rotated_api_key
     RAPIDAPI_HOST=gpt-5-6-sol.p.rapidapi.com
     RAPIDAPI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol
     ```
   - The skill tree builder works without a key, but AI requests will remain disabled.

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Building Your Skill Tree

1. **Navigate the Tree**: Use mouse drag to pan, scroll wheel to zoom
2. **Allocate Points**: Click on skill nodes to increment, right-click (or use controls) to decrement
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor your total points and category-specific points in the top-right panel
4. **Share Your Build**: Click the share button to generate a shareable link
5. **Get AI Suggestions**: Use the AI assistant panel to get build recommendations

### Skill Tree Mechanics

- **Prerequisites**: Some skills require parent skills to be unlocked first
- **Category Requirements**: High-tier skills may require minimum points in their category (e.g., 15, 36 points)
- **Max Ranks**: Each skill has a maximum rank (typically 1 or 5)
- **Point Limit**: Total skill points are capped at 75

## Build Examples

### Solo Raider (Looter Build)
- **Survival**: 40-50 points
- **Mobility**: Low investment
- **Focus**: Silent infiltration, rapid looting, inventory capacity

### Team Combat (Tank Build)
- **Conditioning**: 40-50 points
- **Survival**: Moderate supplement
- **Focus**: Damage absorption, stamina recovery, shield efficiency

### PvP Combat (Flanker Build)
- **Mobility**: 45-55 points
- **Conditioning**: Low investment
- **Focus**: High mobility, tactical dodging, climbing speed
