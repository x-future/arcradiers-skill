## 🧩 Survival Combat Strategies

### Avoidance Over Engagement
**Philosophy**: The best fight is the one you don't have

**Tactics**:

- Timing: move when enemies patrol away

### When You Must Fight
**Preparation**:
- Craft consumables beforehand
- Use superior gear from looting
- Position: choose engagement terrain

**Combat**:
- Quick, decisive engagements
- Disengage if losing
- Use consumables liberally (you can craft more)

### Team Play as Survival
**Your Role**:
- Looting specialist: clear loot areas for team
- Crafter: provide gear and consumables
- Scout: use Stealth to gather intel

**Value Proposition**:
- Teams need someone to loot efficiently
- Crafting support is invaluable
- Information advantage from stealth

## ❌ Survival Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Fighting Unnecessarily
**Problem**: Survival builds aren't combat-specialized
**Solution**: Stealth, positioning, and avoidance over fighting

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Team Synergy
**Problem**: Going pure solo in a team setting
**Solution**: Adapt build for team play, use crafting support

### Mistake 3: Underestimating Preparation
**Problem**: Not investing in starting materials
**Solution**: Preparation (5/5) pays dividends over sessions

### Mistake 4: Looting Without Plan
**Problem**: Random looting is inefficient
**Solution**: Plan routes, prioritize targets, time runs

## 🏆 Survival Player Tips

**From Top 50 Solo Player - "Scavenger"**:
> "Survival is about playing a different game than everyone else. While they fight, I loot. While they chase, I extract. My K/D ratio is terrible but my inventory is always full. That's winning."

**From Dedicated Crafter - "Artisan"**:
> "Master Crafter changes everything. Being able to craft anywhere—in the field, in a bunker, during a fight—means I'm always prepared. Combine with Resourceful and you save so many materials over time."

**From Team Support Main - "Provider"**:
> "People underestimate what a good Survival player brings to a team. I'm not getting kills, but everyone's geared because I looted efficiently. Everyone has consumables because I crafted them. That's value."

**Conclusion**: The Survival branch offers unmatched utility and economic power. While it may lack the combat prowess of Conditioning or Mobility, it excels at what matters most: preparation, accumulation, and self-sufficiency.

For solo players or team support specialists, Survival is not just viable—it's optimal.
