# ARC Raiders Skill Tree: Complete Beginner's Guide (2025)

Welcome to the most comprehensive beginner's guide for the ARC Raiders skill tree system. Whether you're a new player or just starting to optimize your build, this guide will take you from zero to skilled build crafter.

## 🎮 Understanding the Skill Tree System

### What is the Skill Tree?

The skill tree in ARC Raiders is a progression system that allows you to customize your character's capabilities through **75 total skill points** (one per level, up to level 75).

**Three Main Branches**:
1. **Conditioning** - Tankiness, shields, stamina
2. **Mobility** - Speed, dodging, movement
3. **Survival** - Looting, crafting, stealth

Each branch offers distinct playstyles and can be mixed for hybrid builds.

### How Skill Points Work

- **Total Points**: 75 (level 1-75)
- **Category Gates**: Some nodes require X points in the entire branch
- **Prerequisites**: Must unlock parent nodes before children
- **Ranks**: Most nodes have 1 or 5 ranks (invest multiple points)

**Example**: To get a Tier 3 Conditioning node, you might need:
- 50 points in Conditioning branch
- Specific parent nodes unlocked
- Enough remaining points to invest

## 🌳 The Three Branches Explained

- Play tank roles
- Survive longer in fights

**Key Stats**:
- Increased health

- Damage reduction

**Playstyle**: "I'll go first, follow me in"

### Mobility Branch 🏃

**Focus**: Speed and evasion

**Best For**: Players who want to:
- Move faster

- Outmaneuver enemies
- Control engagement distance

**Key Stats**:

**Playstyle**: "Hit hard, hit fast, leave before they react"

### Survival Branch 🎒

**Focus**: Looting and utility

**Best For**: Players who want to:

**Key Stats**:

**Playstyle**: "Preparation beats reaction"

## 🎯 Choosing Your First Build

### Step 1: Identify Your Playstyle

Answer these questions honestly:

1. **Do you prefer leading from the front or supporting from the back?**
   - Front → Conditioning
   - Back → Mobility or Survival

2. **Do you play solo or with a team?**
   - Solo → Survival or Mobility
   - Team → Conditioning

3. **What's more important: surviving hits or avoiding them?**
   - Surviving → Conditioning
   - Avoiding → Mobility

4. **Do you enjoy fighting or looting/crafting?**
   - Fighting → Conditioning or Mobility
   - Looting → Survival

### Step 2: Choose Your Primary Branch

Based on your answers, pick one branch as your **primary** (40-60 points) and one as your **secondary** (15-30 points).

**Recommended Starting Distributions**:

**New Player (Balanced)**:
- 35 Conditioning / 25 Mobility / 15 Survival
- Good at everything, great at nothing
- Easy to learn, forgiving

**Team Player**:
- 50 Conditioning / 15 Mobility / 10 Survival
- Tank for your team, always useful

**Solo Survivor**:
- 15 Conditioning / 25 Mobility / 35 Survival
- Self-sufficient, escape when needed

### Step 3: Level 1-25 Allocation Strategy

**Early Game Priorities** (regardless of branch):

**Levels 1-10: Foundation**
- **Primary Branch**: Invest in tier 1 nodes
- **Health**: Always get some Constitution (Conditioning)
- **Stamina**: Basic stamina management

**Levels 11-25: Specialization Begins**
- **Primary Branch**: Start tier 2 nodes
- **Secondary Branch**: Begin investing

## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Spreading Points Too Thin
**Problem**: Investing equally in all three branches
**Result**: Good at nothing, bad at everything
**Solution**: Choose one primary branch (40-60 points)

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Health
**Problem**: Zero Conditioning investment
**Result**: Die instantly in fights
**Solution**: At minimum, get Iron Constitution (5/5)

### Mistake 3: Respeccing Too Often
**Problem**: Constantly changing build
**Result**: Never learn one build well
**Solution**: Stick with a build for 10+ levels before changing

### Mistake 4: Following Meta Blindly
**Problem**: Copying pros without understanding why
**Result**: Build doesn't match your playstyle
**Solution**: Understand the reasoning behind node choices

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Category Gates
**Problem**: Investing 48 points in a branch, can't unlock tier 3
**Result**: Wasted points, inefficient build
**Solution**: Plan ahead, know category gate requirements
